# Quiz Website Challenge
This project was completed in a time frame of 1 hour and 10 minutes. The challenge was proposed by Micode with the aim of creating a quiz website utilizing AI technologies (https://youtu.be/SyamXfBVjrM?si=BNLXvWwzGd3Jrt-r). The primary objective was to assess the potential impact of AI on the programming profession. The challenge involved designing and implementing a quiz website within a strict time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes.

The competition consisted of three participants: a web-focused computer scientist, a non-web-oriented computer scientist, and a student without prior programming expertise. The participants were tasked with creating a functional quiz website utilizing AI tools. The challenge aimed to examine whether the role of a programmer is at risk of becoming obsolete due to AI advancements.

It is important to note that this project is independent of Micode's YouTube video content. I am a Belgian student pursuing a degree in computer science. This project marks a practical exercise undertaken as part of the preparation for the upcoming Master's program.

For this challenge I used github copilot and chat gpt, since I don't program websites regularly, these tools allowed me to save a lot of time, and we do some of the programming work for me.
